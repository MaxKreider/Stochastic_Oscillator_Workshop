This folder contains two MATLAB functions:

- TimeSeries.m
- Qfunction.m

TimeSeries.m generates time-series data for a noisy stochastic oscillator using the Euler-Maruyama method.
Qfunction.m discretizes the SKO and generates the Q-function for a 2D stochastic oscillator

Each script contains detailed documentation and example input for the interested user.

These functions are used to generate time-series data in Q-function coordinates for a given 2D stochastic oscillator (see the 'Examples' folder).
