This folder contains three examples: a noisy Stuart-Landau oscillator, a noisy FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator, and a noisy Morris-Lecar oscillator

Each script uses the TimeSeries.m and Qfunction.m functions (found in the 'Dependencies' folder) to:
  1. generate time-series data in original coordinates
  2. approximate the Q-function using finite-differences
  3. generate time-series data in Q-function coordinates
  4. visualize the time-series and the Q-function

The scripts may be modified to handle any 2D stochastic oscillator
