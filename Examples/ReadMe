This folder contains three examples: a noisy Stuart-Landau oscillator, a noisy FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator, and a noisy Morris-Lecar oscillator

Each script uses the TimeSeries.m and Qfunction.m functions (found in the 'Dependencies' folder) to:
  1. generate time-series data in original coordinates
  2. approximate the Q-function using finite-differences
  3. generate time-series data in Q-function coordinates
  4. visualize the time-series and the Q-function

The scripts may be modified to handle any 2D stochastic oscillator

To run run any of the examples, download the TimeSeries.m and Qfunction.m functions from the 'Dependencies' folder, and then run any of the examples Main_XXX.m.

Note that the Qfunction.m function may take several minutes to run if very fine discretizations are used.
